### Hi everyone! 
My name is Fabian Harmsen, and I'm a 26-year-old software developer.   

## On my Github page, you'll find a collection of

- my learning projects in various technologies, 
- university projects, 
- and some quick and dirty code for one-time use. 

## My History:
I completed my apprenticeship as 'Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwickler' at the University of Siegen (2013-2017), where I had the opportunity to work on a range of exciting projects, such as the UIPM laser target homologation and the development of a stereolithography 3D printer for my IHK graduation project.

Throughout my career, I've gained expertise in several programming languages, including C, C++, C# (beginner level), PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm currently working as a developer at AMEFA GmbH (2017-2023) and FHIT GmbH (2023-now), where I specialize in developing and maintaining complex systems and solutions.

Aside from my work, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics at the University of Applied Sciences Mainz (2020 - Feb. 2024). In my free time, I enjoy astrophotography, which allows me to capture the beauty of the universe through my camera lens.



If you're interested in collaborating with me or learning more about my work, don't hesitate to reach out!
